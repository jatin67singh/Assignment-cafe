<h1>This weekend special brunch</h1>

<p>A café is a type of restaurant which typically serves coffee and tea, in addition to light refreshments such as baked goods or snacks. The term "café" comes from the French word meaning "coffee".



A café setting is known as a casual social environment where you can find people reading newspapers and magazines, studying, or chatting with others about current events. It is known also regarded as a place where information can be exchanged.



A café is sometimes called a coffeehouse or a coffee shop or tea shop in English, a café in French and a bar in Italian. (Cafe or café is the common spelling used in English, French, Spanish, et al however the word is spelled "caffe" in Italian.) It shares some characteristics of a bar and some characteristics of a restaurant given its selection of foods and beverages served, but is distinct from a cafeteria which is a type of restaurant where customers can choose from many dishes displayed on a serving line. In some countries, cafés are designed to more closely resemble restaurants whereby offering a range of hot meals and possibly licensed to serve alcohol. Most British cafés however, do not sell alcohol likely due to the prominent pub culture.</p>
